# Iris-Flower-Classification-KNN
This project demonstrates how to use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify Iris flowers. The code loads the Iris flower dataset from a CSV file, splits the data into training and testing sets, trains a KNN classifier, and evaluates the model's accuracy. The code also visualizes the Iris flower dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
